This project is a simple RESTful API server built using Go and the Gin framework, with a MySQL database. The server provides endpoints to manage and retrieve information about people, their phone numbers, and addresses.

First go mod tidy or go mod download command need to be run for the required packages to install.
Also this project requires setting up of Mysql DB. then adding details of the DB in the connection string should work.

Thank you!.
